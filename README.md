## ðŸ“· Skin Lesion Classification

### About

Project for skin lesion classification, attempting to predict diagnoses as either cancerous or non-cancerous. The main method used to accomplish this is image classification, employing methods from scikit-learn and scikit-image. However, a linear regression model based on image metadata is also included.

This is a finished repository. Re-training models (using previously extracted image features) and classifying new images is possible using the trainer.py and classify.py scripts, while reproduction of plots and figures is possible from the included jupyter notebooks. To save space, only the pictures needed to reproduce plots and figures are included in this repository. This means that re-extracting image features is not possible from this repository. A copy of this repository including all images and masks used to produce image features can be found at https://github.com/julielhagen/First-Year-Project.
