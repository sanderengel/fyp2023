### Color module. First part uses SLIC segmentation algorithm to segment lesion by color in area marked by mask.
### Further describes the colors by calculating the mean of each segment from SLIC and computing variance
### or standard deviation between these means, either in RGB or HSV color space.
### Second part (dominance) uses KMeans to compute dominant colors from HSV color space.
